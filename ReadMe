This repository is for my CIS capstone project. 

The main objective for this project was to develop a website for a client who owns an auto mobile detailing company. For the development of the project, 
I will use Amazon Web Services to utilize cloud services. I will develop the website based on the needs and wants that are required from the client, 
to best suit his business plan.

Attached to this repository is the HTML and CSS code for the website that was built for this website. Attached as well with this repository is the 
project slides that go in more detail about various parts of the project.

This is not the finished product of the project, but only the beginning. There are plans on what the next step in the project, that will give this website some 
more flavor.

Thank you!
